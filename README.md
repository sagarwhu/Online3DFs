## Authors 

* Md Alamgir Kabir, Jacky Keung


## Research Questions 

```
* RQ1: Impacts of Online3DFs - The Online3DFs framework with automated FS significantly outperformed the conventional CVDP models using all feature sets in terms of G-mean and Confs and Cfs outperformed All in terms of F1
* RQ2: How does automated FS compared with fixed-size feature sets?: Cfs achieved the maximum G-mean and the AutoSpeaman gained the highest average F1
* RQ3: Which FS is robust to concept drift?: The AutoSpearman achieved the highest F1 by 78.9% and had maximum stable models than the other benchmark methods
```
